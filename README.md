# personal-python

This is a Nix flake that uses uv2nix to bundle hundreds of packages
that I commonly use when writing random Python scripts.

The intent is that this provides a "batteries included++" experience
where you get a modern Python interpreter with an up-to-date and
intercompatible package set for working in these domains:
* AWS and cloud infrastructure
* Web scraping and HTTP clients
* Data science, numerical computing, and visualization
* Image, audio, and media processing
* Cryptography and security tooling
* Databases and ORMs
* Web frameworks and servers
* Networking and protocols
* Serialization and data formats
* AI and NLP
* Developer tooling (linters, formatters, type checkers, testing)
* Async and concurrency
